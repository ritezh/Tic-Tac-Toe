Tic-Tac-Toe is a board-game. It has two players. Each player has an icon depicting a nought ( O ) or a cross ( X ). The board is divided into 3X3 squares and each square can be occupied by one icon. If three icons of same type appear in a row either vertically or horizantally or diagonally, the user of that icon will be declared winner by the system. If all the squares of the board are filled and no user is the winner then the game is declared as draw by the system. If a player quits the game then his opponent will be declared winner by the system. Upon starting the game, the system should allow the players to make moves alternatively or to quit.
